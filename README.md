# WowBattleBot
An IRC Bot that can play Pokemon

# Why am I here?
Welcome to Battle Dungeon! Chances are you were invited by an automated script ran by someone else. Me and my bot did not invite you (unless you were challenged to a Battle, then you were invited by the bot)

# Music

# Commands
Command parameters with `<>` are required, parameters with `[]` are optional. Commands seperated by a `|` do the same thing.

| Command  | Purpose |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `!battle`  | Puts you in a battle with a Random Pokemon and gives you a Random Pokemon to fight.  |
| `!randbat <@username> [num]`  | Challenges `username` to a battle. Change `num` to a number between 1 and 6 for a Multi-Pokemon battle.  |
| `!safari` | Puts you in a Safari battle with a Random pokemon. Gives you a rock, bait, and Pokeballs to catch the random Pokemon. |
| `!changeclass <class> | !switchclass <class>`| Changes your Trainer Class. Cannot be "Gym Leader", "Champion", "Elite Four" or any other protected class.
| `!list` | Gets a list of your current Pokemon in battles with more than 1 Pokemon per team. |
| `!switch<number>` | Switches your Pokemon to the `number` specified. `number` is gotten from the `!list` command. |
| `!check<number>` | Checks the Pokemon `number` specified. `number` is gotten from the `!list` command. |
| `!move<number>` | Uses the Move from your Pokemon against your opponent. |

# Capturing Pokemon

As of right now, it's not possible to capture Pokemon during battle. In Safari battles, you can capture Pokemon, however, any Pokemon caught are not saved. This will change in the future.
